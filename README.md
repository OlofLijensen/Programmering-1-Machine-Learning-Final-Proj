Machine learning folder contains my final project for Programering 1. It was coded all by myself during the first year of gymnasium. The project is a KNN machine learning algortihm which predicts that if the given data belongs to a person who earns more or less then 50k. 

ProgOlympiad folder contains 2 attemps at solutions for programing olympiad that i also particapated during the first year. "Uppgift 1" contains a solution for one of the problems. The solution which i wrote was however to slow so full points for the question was not awarded. (Considering it was for a competion the code did not have to be commented)

The finale folder "Excersises Prog1" contains uncommented code of solution to practise problems given to me during the course programming 1.
